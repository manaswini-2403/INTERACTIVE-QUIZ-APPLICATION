*DESCRIPTION*:
The **"Quiz Royal Battle"** is a dynamic and interactive web-based quiz application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aimed at testing and improving users’ knowledge of basic programming and coding concepts. The application features a clean and modern UI with animated particle backgrounds and celebratory fireworks effects to enhance user engagement. It presents 10 multiple-choice questions on topics like Python, HTML, CSS, C, SQL, and general coding logic. Each question includes a 15-second countdown timer, after which the app automatically moves to the next question if no answer is selected, displaying a “Time’s up” message. When a user selects an answer, the app immediately provides feedback, highlights the correct answer, and offers a brief explanation, reinforcing learning. At the end of the quiz, the user is shown their score out of 10 along with a motivational message based on their performance, and a "Submit" button allows them to finalize the session. The app is fully responsive and uses canvas and JavaScript to create animated fireworks when a user answers correctly, offering both functionality and an engaging experience. Overall, the project demonstrates front-end development skills, creative UI/UX thinking, and the ability to integrate logic with design to create a complete educational tool.
